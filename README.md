# PlayAtlas

## Application Architecture

### Scoring Engine Architecture

A **score engine** is a modular component responsible for computing classification scores for games and producing a structured breakdown that explains how the score was derived.

Each classification (e.g., _Horror_, _RPG_, _Survival_) has its own independent score engine. Engines are versioned, deterministic, and designed to evolve safely over time while preserving historical data.

To learn more about the internals of score engines and how to create new ones, visit [Scoring Engine Architecture](/packages/@playatlas/game-library/src/application/scoring-engine/)

## Getting Started

TODO: how to install PlayAtlas

## Development Setup

### Local Development Server

To start the local development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then, open a browser and navigate to **http://localhost:3001**.

### Building Container Image

To build the Svelte application container image, run the following command at the project's root:

```bash
docker build --tag playatlas:latest --target prod .
```

### Running Production Container

If you want to run a local Podman container to test the final image, transfer it from Docker to the Podman local registry:

```bash
docker save playatlas | podman load
```

You can deploy the container using the example Ansible role at `podman/playatlas`.

Alternatively, you may use this Podman Run command:

```bash
podman run -d \
  --name playatlas \
  --restart=always \
  -v playatlas-data:/app/data \
  -e TZ=America/Sao_Paulo \
  -e PLAYATLAS_LOG_LEVEL=0 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000/tcp \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000/udp \
  docker.io/library/playatlas
```

### Running Tests

To run all unit and integration tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To run all unit tests:

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```
