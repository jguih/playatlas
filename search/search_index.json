It's used by both client and server to determine if they're in sync with each other.</p> <p>A SyncId is issued the first time the PlayAtlas server is started and shared with all clients. It is immutable by design and can only be changed manually through a server reset.</p> <p>When the client attempts to create or update an entity that requires synchronization, it must send a valid SyncId. The server then:</p> <ul> <li>Rejects the request if the received SyncId doesn't match its own.</li> <li>Or, If the server's SyncId is the same as the one sent by the client, accepts the request and persists the received entity in the database, overwriting any existing entity with same id.</li> </ul> <p>The client keeps the last known SyncId in its local database and includes it on every request. It also checks with the server if both have the same SyncId before attempting synchronization. After getting a response from the server, the client will:</p> <ul> <li>Synchronize any queued pending changes with the server.</li> <li>Or, when the server responds with code 409 (conflict), will initiate a reconciliation, sending it's entire dataset state to the server.</li> </ul> <p>When the client requests a reconciliation, both client and server exchange their current dataset states and merge any pending changes using the 'last write wins' strategy. In addition, the server shares it's SyncId with the client. This ensures that the server and all clients remain in sync, even if a client or the server database is lost or wiped.</p>"},{"location":"overview/quick-start/","title":"Quick Start","text":"<p>Here's a quick way to install PlayAtlas so you can try it out as soon as possible.</p>"},{"location":"overview/quick-start/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<ul> <li> <p>A dedicated Linux host that:</p> <ul> <li>Can run Podman containers</li> <li>Has a reverse-proxy to terminate TLS</li> <li>Allows TCP connections on port 3000 over LAN</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>A personal Windows host with Playnite installed.</p> </li> <li>A client device (mobile or desktop) with a modern browser (Firefox or Chromium-based).</li> </ul> <p>Warning</p> <p>PlayAtlas is a distributed solution requiring at least 3 distinct devices.
